    "When engaging with content in our model world, corporations use recommender system to suggest future content we might like based on the attributes of the content. Be it movies or books that we may be interested in with the goal of keeping customer interested andf However this may cause an echo chamber effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extreme example of an echo chamber caused by recommender system is youtube's algorithm suggesting alt-right content which may lead to an individual developing extremist views. And this a problem of overtraining, because what is recommended is based on the data that is inputed to the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify uses a common method for producing recommendations known as collaborative filtering which generates recommendations based on the combined preferences of the consumer requesting recommendations and those of other consumers. The underlying issue with this method is that song recommendations are based on the 'crowd'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as the business model of Spotify is built in a way where artists are compensated by number of streams, the homegenization of new music become more prevalent. Such as making songs more catchier and shorter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender system I would like to propose is for users to be recommended songs based on the 'DNA' of the music they have been listening to with the goal of potentially exposing the listener to songs form different genres and epochs. This is threfore a cluster or nearest neighbour recommendation system. This would broaden the horizon of music listeners and also bring attention to artists that create music as an artform as opposed to achieving the highest streaming numbers. "

During comparison, useful information had also reveal itself such as that non exact 'duplicate' of the same song, are rereleased or remastered. This may affect their popularity, but moving forward, I believe that the granualirity of the popularity does not matter and I would threfore bucket them, making this feature categorical. \n",

    "In terms of duplicates as one song is the remastered version of the other. By definition, remastering music is essentially improving on the quality of the original copy of a song or album. Removing flaws from the music, providing a cleaner, sharper and more refined listening experience whilst trying to bringing the music up to date with current standard. After remastering, certain attributes of the song would still generally remain the same, such as key, time signature, duration, tempo and speechiness. Nonetheless these duplicates, I would not remove them, as there are some music enthusiast that actually prefered 'non tampered' music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there are some artist that generally do not make explicit music, and would therefore not have duplicates of the same song where they only differ in explicity. Removing duplciates by only keeping explicit songs would therefore result in removing many artists.\n"
